Real-time attack (or **RTA**) refers to the method a speedrun is timed in real-time, with external means. This includes load screens, pause screens, cutscenes, times when the console or game has to be restarted, and time when a savefile has to be loaded, for example after a death.

RTA is used to determine the final time of [Dark Souls II](/dark-souls-ii) and [Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin](/dark-souls-ii/scholar-of-the-first-sin) speedruns.
