title: "Exploit"

**Exploits** usually are intentionally caused [glitches](/glitch) that lead to situations clearly not intended by the developers of a given application or game. In video games, these most often are item duplications and warps (displacement of the player character through/into not (yet) accessible areas).

Please see our [category](/Category:Glitch 'Category:Glitch') on all glitches and exploits we feature.
