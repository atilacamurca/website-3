title: "Sequence Break"
---

A **sequence break** is the execution of narrative story events in a normally not attainable order, usually skipping normally essential parts of the plot in the process. For example, in [The Duke's Archives](//darksouls.wikidot.com/the-duke-s-archives) it is normally not possible to reach the second and third area without dying in the first encounter with Seath the Scaleless and getting imprisoned. The [Duke Skip](/duke-skip) completely avoids this by doing an unintended action that lets you access the second area before even encountering Seath first.
